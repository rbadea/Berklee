Assignment 5 part 1 - notes

I have re-used code from other assignments (such as displaying the artwork), so adding a song to the list
will pull the image and display it as well.
I then re-used code for assigning an 'on-click' action for each created image
At the on-click action the function will look in the original list of songs for all other pieces of information
To display the info I used a textbox element . Updating it's value makes it really easy to update the screen.
Not the most elegant solution for the task, but it does the work.
Ignore the title - it is meaningless...
